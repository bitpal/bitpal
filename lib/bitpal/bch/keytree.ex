defmodule BitPal.BCH.KeyTree do
  @moduledoc """
  This module implements BIP-0032: derivation of private and public keys from a
  public or private master key (see: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)

  The idea is quite simple. This module implements two functions:
  - to_public(private) - generates a public key from a private key (can't spend coins using the public key).
  - child_key(key, id) - generate a child key derived from key, which may be either a public or a private key.

  Based on these function (mainly, child_key), we can imagine a tree with the root in the master key
  (m for the private key and M for the public key). Each key has 0x7FFFFFFF*2 children. 0..0x7FFFFFF
  are regular child keys, and 0x80000000.. are "hardened keys" (can't derive them from public keys,
  but can be used to derive public keys). In this implementation, we use negative numbers to denote
  hardened keys (the spec uses 1' for a hardened key). Note that 0' is represented as -1, 1' as -2
  and so on.

  In this scheme, it is meaningful to assign each key with a "derivation path" as a sequence of
  numbers, like so: m / 1 / 5 / 8

  These works much like directories in your regular file system, except that we can only use
  numbers. Some of these have a specific meaning. See BIP-0044 or BIP-0043 for more details. This
  module is only concerned with key derivation, so it does not impose any restrictions.

  This module represents a derivation path as a list of numbers. It also contains the ability to
  parse a string in a "standard" representation into a list of numbers that can later be manipulated
  as desired. It is worth noting that this representation does not concern itself with whether or
  not we are talking about public or private keys (i.e. the leading m or M). This is since we want
  it to be easy to take substrings of this representation to divide the derivation into multiple
  steps. This is since we typically don't start with the master key, but a derived key at some
  level. The symbol :public can be used to enforce a public key at some point.
